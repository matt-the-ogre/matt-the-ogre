### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal GitHub account.

I work for Cognitive3D. I live in Canada. I volunteer at [Backcountry Discovery Routes](https://ridebdr.com/) as an ambassador, the University of Waterloo on the [Alumni Council](https://uwaterloo.ca/alumni/about-us/alumni-council), and sometimes do mentoring and coaching for students and new grads.
