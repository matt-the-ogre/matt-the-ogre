### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal GitHub account.

I work for Microsoft. I live in Canada. I volunteer with Lime Connect as a member of the board for Canada, Backcountry Discovery Routes as an ambassador, the University of Waterloo on the Alumni Council, and sometimes do mentoring and coaching.
